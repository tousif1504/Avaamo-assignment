## DevOps Assignment

### Overview

Welcome to the DevOps assignment! This assignment is designed to assess skills and knowledge in the field of DevOps. I would like to demonstrate my understanding of DevOps principles, tools, and practices by completing the tasks given below.

### Instructions

1. Fork this repository to your own GitHub account.
2. Create a new branch in your forked repository to work on the assignment.
3. Read the requirements and tasks carefully before proceeding.
4. Implement the tasks using the technologies and tools you find appropriate.
5. Commit your changes and push them to your branch.
6. Once you have completed the tasks, create a pull request from your branch to the main repository.
7. Notify us via email that you have completed the assignment and provide the link to your pull request.

### Requirements

To complete this assignment, you will need the following:

- A working knowledge of DevOps principles and practices.
- Familiarity with version control systems, preferably Git.
- Experience with Administration for linux and windows.
- Experience in Networking and Security.
- Familiarity with containerization & Orchestration tools like Docker & Kubernetes.
- Proficiency in Scripting in Shell and python.
- Knowledge of cloud platforms, particularly AWS or Azure.


### Tasks

Git commands:
1. How do you set up a script to run every time a repository receives new commits through push?
2. How do you find a list of files that have changed in a particular commit?

Monitoring using scripts:
1. Monitor a log file, detect a pattern detection, send an email on detection
2. Monitor process particular process on an instance, send an email on incase of state change like process got stopped, taking more CPU that threshold

Docker:
1. Create a sample docker container with a Node.js Express app and demonstrate the installation.
Guidelines :
● You should be able to find what system packages are needed by looking through the app
● You should not need to change the app code in any way
● The app should be running as a non-privileged user
● The app should be automatically restarted if crashes or is killed
● The app should maximize all of the available CPUs
● Timezone should be in IST
● Follow best practices when writing a dockerfile

Security:
1. Show how to block ports
2. Show how to setup port forwarding

Network:
1. Show list of processes using the network.
2. Show the list of IPs a process is connected to
3. Show how to list open files and kill processes tied to a user

Code:
Write a short program that prints each number from 1 to 100 on a new line.
For each multiple of 3, print "AVA" instead of the number.
For each multiple of 5, print "AMO" instead of the number.
For numbers which are multiples of both 3 and 5, print "AVAAMO" instead of the number.
NB: Any programming/scripting language can be used to do the above


#Documentation:
   - Provide a detailed README.md file with clear instructions on Tasks with solutions.
